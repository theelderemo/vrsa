Hey everyone got some updates for you:

You can now create accounts with usernames. Sign up with email, make a username, and you're in. Also added Cloudflare captcha so bots can fuck off.
Added a "Studio Pass" system - if you support the project on BMC (buymeacoffee.com/theelderemo/membership), you unlock premium models (the ones that cost me actual noticeble money lol). This helps keep the lights on and lets me keep adding more models, free and pro.

Both Ghostwriter and Analyzer modes now require login. Had to do this to manage API costs and prevent abuse. Sorry for the extra step, but it's necessary to keep the app sustainable.

Completely redesigned the rhyme controls interface. Instead of massive checkbox lists taking up half your screen, everything's now in clean dropdown menus. Way less cluttered, way easier to use.

Added two new rhyme pattern options: ABCCB Pattern and ABCCA. 

Added a whole new section called "Poetic Forms" with 17 options: Haiku, Sonnet, Free verse, Limerick, Villanelle, Elegy, Ode, Acrostic, Sestina, Narrative, Cinquain, Prose, Ekphrastic, Pantoum, Pastoral, Ballad, and Ghazal.

Known issues: None right now but hit me up if something breaks

Let me know what you think.
